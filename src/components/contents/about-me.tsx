            I am a passionate software developer with a deep curiosity for
            technology and a love for building meaningful digital products. My
            interests span across AI/ML, blockchain, automation, and
            full-spectrum software developmentâ€”from web and mobile apps to
            desktop tools, APIs, and CLIs. I enjoy diving into new challenges,
            solving complex problems, and constantly pushing myself to grow as a
            developer. My focus is always on building smooth, reliable, and
            purposeful experiences that make a real impact. Outside of coding, I
            am often exploring new tech trends or brainstorming ideas for tools
            that can simplify life. Let&apos;s create something powerful
            together! ðŸš€
